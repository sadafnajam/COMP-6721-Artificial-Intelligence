11 Puzzle Problem
Implement a solution for the 11d-puzzle using the following 3 search algorithms: A. Depth-first search (DFS)
B. Best-first search (BFS)
C. Algorithm A* (A*)
Ties between equivalent nodes should be broken in a clockwise direction starting with UP. This means that equivalent moves are ordered this way:
UP > UP –RIGHT > RIGHT > DOWN- RIGHT > DOWN > DOWN –LEFT > LEFT > UP–LEFT
(most preferred moves) (least preferred moves)
For BFS and A*, you must experiment with 2 different heuristics h1 and h2 of your choice. h1 and h2 should both be used with BFS and with A*.
